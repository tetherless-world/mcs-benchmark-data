The CycIC dataset is a set of multiple choice and true/false questions requiring general common sense knowledge and reasoning in a very broad variety of areas, including simple reasoning about time, place, everyday objects, events, and situations. Some of the questions require a small bit of logic to get the right answer.",

Contrary to many prior benchmarks that focus on physical or taxonomic knowledge, Social IQa focuses on reasoning about people’s actions and their social implications. For example, given an action like \"Jesse saw a concert\" and a question like \"Why did Jesse do this?\", humans can easily infer that Jesse wanted \"to see their favorite performer\" or \"to enjoy the music\", and not \"to see what's happening inside\" or \"to see if it works\". The actions in Social IQa span a wide variety of social situations, and answer candidates contain both human-curated answers and adversarially-filtered machine-generated candidates. Social IQa contains over 37,000 QA pairs for evaluating models’ abilities to reason about the social implications of everyday events and situations.",
