  <instance id="0" scenario="changing a light bulb">
    <text>I went into my bedroom and flipped the light switch. Oh, I see that the ceiling lamp is not turning on. It must be that the light bulb needs replacement. I go through my closet and find a new light bulb that will fit this lamp and place it in my pocket. I also get my stepladder and place it under the lamp. I make sure the light switch is in the off position. I climb up the ladder and unscrew the old light bulb. I place the old bulb in my pocket and take out the new one. I then screw in the new bulb. I climb down the stepladder and place it back into the closet. I then throw out the old bulb into the recycling bin. I go back to my bedroom and turn on the light switch. I am happy to see that there is again light in my room.</text>

  <instance id="1" scenario="having a barbecue">
    <text>The weather was so nice today that I decided to have a barbecue. I called up some of my friends to invite them over. I set up some chairs and tables outside for my friends to sit around. I then took out some hot dogs from my fridge and brought them over to my barbecue. My barbecue is a gas barbecue, so all I had to do was press the knob and turn it to ignite it. Once I got a little fire going I put my hot dogs on the grill over it to cook. I closed the lid and left my hot dogs to cook for about ten minutes. After ten minutes I decided to check on them to see if they were done. They looked like they were cooked, so I put them all on a plate to serve to my friends. I went to my kitchen and got hot dog buns, ketchup, mustard, and relish to serve on top of the hot dogs. I laid out all of the food and condiments on the table so my friends could help themselves. We ate the hot dogs and relaxed around the table.</text>
