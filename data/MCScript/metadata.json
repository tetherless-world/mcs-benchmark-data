For this ma-chine comprehension task,  we created a newcorpus,MCScript.    It  contains  a  high  num-ber  of  questions  that  require  commonsenseknowledge for finding the correct answer.  11teams  from  4  different  countries  participatedin  this  shared  task,  most  of  them  used  neu-ral  approaches.   The  best  performing  systemachieves an accuracy of 83.95%,  outperform-ing  the  baselines  by  a  large  margin,  but  stillfar from the human upper bound,  which wasfound to be at 98%.",
