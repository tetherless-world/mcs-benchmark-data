  <instance id="0" scenario="getting the newspaper">
    <text>Early this morning I woke up to the sound of my newspaper landing on my driveway. I sat up and wrapped my pink robe around me. I slipped my feet into my slippers and looked at the clock. It was only 7:00 but it was time for me to get my newspaper and drink some coffee. I looked out the window and noticed it was raining quite a bit. I saw the newspaper at the end of my driveway, as far away as it could be. I grabbed my umbrella out of my coat closet and opened my front door enough to stick the umbrella through and open it outside. I stepped out the door and quickly covered my head with the umbrella. Then I ran to the end of my driveway, scooped up the newspaper in its plastic wrapping, and ran back to my front door. I closed my umbrella, took off my slippers, and dried off. Then, I unwrapped my newspaper and sat down to read it.</text>

  <instance id="1" scenario="setting the dining table">
    <text>First, we clear everything off the dining table that isn't related to dinner, such as crayons and papers and computers.  Then, we count how many people are going to come to dinner. Tonight, there is Mom, and Dad, and Grandma, and Grandpa, and Tom, and the Baby. So, we are having five people, and one person in the high chair. Then, we go get the five placemats out of the side cabinet. After we set the placemats neatly at chair. After we set a placemat at each chair, we go get the plates. Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Grandpa all get big plates, but Tom is still little, so he gets a small plastic plate. We set a plate on each placemat. Now we need a napkin for each place. Luckily, we still have some napkins left over from the birthday party last week, so we will use those. It doesn't matter that they say &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot; We put a folded napkin to the left side of each plate. On top of each napkin we put a fork. Except for Tom, he gets a small fork. On the right side of the plate we put a knife and spoon. We need to be careful with the knives. Closer to the center of the table we put a glass by each plate. Tom gets a plastic glass, because he isn't ready for a real glass one yet. We are ready to eat!</text>
